# Introduction to Question Generation

Question generation is the process of creating meaningful questions from text, concepts, or user input. It supports learning by encouraging curiosity, improving understanding, and helping students think more deeply about a topic. In AI systems, question generation enables automated tutoring, assessments, and interactive learning experiences. A simple question can guide attention, stimulate thinking, and make learning more active and engaging.
